##A Cost of Goods Management System for Pharma Industries

This app is a comprehensive Management System designed to help pharmaceutical industries efficiently organize, track, and modify their cost of goods. This system aims to provide transparency, optimize cost structures, and facilitate informed decision-making throughout the production process.
The frontend for this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite).
The backend for this project was built using [Express js](https://github.com/expressjs/express) and [MySQL](https://github.com/mysql).

## Key Features
**Centralized Database**: The app utilizes a robust and secure database to store all cost-related data, including raw materials, manufacturing costs, labor expenses, equipment costs, and packaging materials.

**User Authentication and Access Control**: The system implements a secure user authentication mechanism with role-based access control, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access and modify cost data.

**Intuitive Data Entry**: PharmaCost offers an easy-to-use interface for entering cost information at different stages of the production process, allowing seamless data entry and updates.

**Real-time Cost Calculation and Analysis(Coming soon)**: The system incorporates advanced algorithms to calculate the total cost of goods based on the entered data, and provides insightful analysis and cost breakdowns.

**Comprehensive Reporting and Visualization**: Generate detailed reports and visualizations to present cost-related data in a clear and understandable format. Key performance indicators and trends are highlighted to aid decision-making.

**Supplier Management(Coming Soon)**: The system offers a supplier management module, allowing organizations to evaluate supplier performance, negotiate terms, and monitor associated costs.
